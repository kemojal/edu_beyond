The project is approached following these several steps:

1. Set up the project:

Initialize a new TypeScript project
Install necessary dependencies (e.g., Express for the HTTP server)
Configure TypeScript and project structure


2. Implement the API:

Create a basic Express server
Implement the GET route at "/"
Implement the POST route at "/upload" with file type checking


3. Create custom middleware:

Implement file size limiting middleware (10MB limit)
Implement rate limiting middleware (10 calls per minute per IP)


4. Write tests:

Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest)
Write unit tests for each route and middleware
Write integration tests to check the overall functionality


5. Documentation and code cleanup:

Add comments and documentation
Refactor and optimize code
Ensure code readability and follow best practices
